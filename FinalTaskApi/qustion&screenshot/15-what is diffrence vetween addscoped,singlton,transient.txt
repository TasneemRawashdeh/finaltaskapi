Singleton

When we register a type as singleton, only one instance is available throughout the application and for every request.

It is similar to having a static object.

The instance is created for the first request and the same is available throughout the application and for each subsequent requests.






Scoped

When we register a type as Scoped, one instance is available throughout the application per request. When a new request comes in, the new instance is created. Add scoped specifies that a single object is available per request.




Transient

When we register a type as Transient, every time a new instance is created. Transient creates new instance for every service/ controller as well as for every request and every user.
